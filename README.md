Data analysis and visualisation of two datasets. One that describes the amount of Personal Computers and another one the amount of Mobile Phones per 100 people.
You can add countries to the list, that should be described in the different plots. There are plots for describing a possible correlation between PC's and Mobile Phones (where a third variable, the GNI, is integrated) - scatterplots - and lineplots, describing the development of PC and Phone occurence over time.
